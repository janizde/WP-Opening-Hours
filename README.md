## <a name="installation"></a>Installation

### <a name="wordpress-plugin-installer"></a>WordPress Plugin Installer
1. Go to your WordPress dashboard
1. Navigate to "Plugins"
1. Click "Install"
1. Search for "Opening Hours"
1. Click "Install" on the Plugin "Opening Hours" by Jannik Portz
1. Activate the Plugin

### <a name="manual-installation"></a>Manual Installation
1. Download the .zip-archive from <https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-opening-hours/>
1. Unzip the archive
1. Upload the directory /opening-hours to your wp-content/plugins
1. In your Admin Panel go to Plugins and active the Opening Hours Plugin
1. Now you can edit your Opening Hours in the Settings-Section
1. Place the Widgets in your Sidebars or use the Shortcode in your posts and Pages

### <a name="composer"></a>Composer
If you are managing your WordPress Plugins via composer (e.g. when using [Bedrock](https://roots.io/bedrock/docs/composer/)) the Opening Hours Plugin is also available on [wpackagist](https://wpackagist.org/).

Make sure you have wpackagist registered as repository in your composer.json file

~~~json
"repositories": [
  {
    "type": "composer",
    "url": "https://wpackagist.org"
  }
],
~~~

Add the Opening Hours plugin as dependency

~~~json
"require": {
  "wpackagist-plugin/wp-opening-hours": "1.2"
}
~~~

### <a name="clone-repository"></a>From GitHub repository
Especially when installing a beta version for testing it makes sense to clone the GitHub Repository and checkout the branch
from which you want to install the plugin. Before you can actually use the plugin you will have to perform the following steps **(Node.js required)**

1. Open your command line and navigate to the project directory
1. Make sure you have already loaded the submodules. If not run `git submodule update`
1. If you do not already have gulp installed globally run `npm install -g gulp`
1. `npm install`
1. `gulp build`

Alternatively you can also clone the repository somewhere on your computer and run `gulp export` instead of `gulp build`.
A .zip archive containing a built version of the plugin will be placed inside the project directory that you can unzip and place in
the `wp-content/plugins` directory of the WordPress installation of your choice.

## <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started
### <a name="set-up"></a>Setting up your Opening Hours

The first step to set up your Opening Hours is to create a Set.
A Set consists of Periods for all weekdays, Holidays and Irregular Openings.
If you only want to display the Opening Hours for one venue you're fine with a single Set but you can as well add multiple Sets, each representing individual Opening Hours. You can for example add one Set for your restaurant and one Set for your Bar if you use one website for them and specify the desired Set per Widget or Shortcode.

**Please Note: You will need to have administrator priviledges to manage Sets**

**Step 1:** Go to your admin Dashboard and navigate to "Opening Hours". You will see a list of all your Sets. To add a new Set click "Add New" next to the heading.

![Opening Hours Menu](./doc/screenshots/menu.png)

**Step 2:** Give your Set a name in the "Enter title here" input. The name is only used internally and you can specify individual titles per Widget or Shortcode.

![Specify Set name](./doc/screenshots/set-name.png)

**Step 3:** Set up Opening Hours. In the Opening Hours Section you can edit the time inputs for each weekday. When clicking the `+`-Button you can add more periods per day. When clicking the `x`-Button next to a period you can delete periods.

![Specify Opening Hours](./doc/screenshots/opening-hours.png)

**Step 4:** Set up Holidays. In the Holidays Section you can edit the name and the start and end dates. When clicking the "Add New Holiday" you can add more Holidays. You can also delete holidays when clicking the `x`-Button next to a Holiday.

![Specify Holidays](./doc/screenshots/holidays.png)

**Step 5:** Set up Irregular Openings. Irregular Openings specify irregular opening hours for a specific day. You would for example add an Irregular Opening for NYE when you are only open in the morning. You can edit the name, the date and start and end time.  
When clicking the "Add New Irregular Opening" you can add more Irregular Openings. You can also delete Irregular Openings when clicking the `x`-Button next to a row.

![Specify Irregular Openings](./doc/screenshots/irregular-openings.png)

**Step 6 (optional):** In the Set Details Section you can give your Set a description. This is optional but the description can be displayed in the Overview Widget/Shortcode.

![Specify Set name](./doc/screenshots/set-description.png)

<a name="getting-started-specify-set-alias"></a>
**Step 7 (optional):** In the Set Details section you can also set your custom Set Alias [which you can use instead of the Set Id in Shortcodes.](#common-attributes) If you specify a specific Set Alias for more than one Set all Shortcodes will use the Set with the least value for `menu_order`.  
Your Theme or a 3rd party Plugin [may also specify Set Alias presets](./doc/filters.md#op_set_alias_presets) to make it easier for yor to enter the right one. Please note that Set Alias presets only work in browsers supporting HTML5 `datalist`.

![Specify Set Alias](./doc/screenshots/set-alias-presets.png)

**Step 8:** Save the data by clicking the "Save"/"Publish"-Button. **Any changes will not be saved without saving the whole Set!**

### <a name="child-sets"></a>Child Sets

You may also set up child Sets with different Opening Hours for a longer Period of time. You can define a date range or a week scheme (even/odd weeks) when the Opening Hours of the Child Set should be used. You can for example use Child Sets if you have different Opening Hours in winter.   
In Child Sets you can only set up Opening Hours but no Holidays or Irregular Openings.

**Step 1:** Make sure you have another Set which you can use as parent Set with the "regular" Opening Hours.

**Step 2:** Add a new Set by clicking the "Add New"-Button in the list of Sets.

**Step 3:** In the Attributes Section select the parent Set under "Parent".

![Specify parent Set](./doc/screenshots/child-set-parent.png)

**Step 4:** Click the "Save"/"Publish"-Button

**Step 5:** Set up the custom Opening Hours for the Child Set.

**Step 6:** Set the usage criteria in the Set Details Section. You can set a start and end date and/or a week scheme. Note that if you don't set start or end date and leave week scheme at "Every Week" the Child Set will never be used.

![Specify child Set criteria](./doc/screenshots/child-set-criteria.png)

**Step 7:** Save the Child Set.

The Plugin will now automatically use the Opening Hours of the Child Set when the usage criteria matches the current time.

## <a name="shortcodes"></a>Shortcodes

### About Shortcodes

Shortcodes are a WordPress core component, which give you the ability to add rich components to your posts' and pages' content. You can insert a Shortcode in the default WordPress editor.

The basic format of a shortcode is:

```
[shortcode-tag an_attribute="attr_value" another_attribute="another_attr_value"]
```

> **Heads up**  
> Shortcode attributes of type `bool` can either be `true` (meaning "yes") or `false` (meaning "no").

You can read more about Shortcodes in the [WordPress documentation.](https://codex.wordpress.org/Shortcode)

Shortcodes have exactly the same options as Widgets because every Widget is basically a representation of the corresponding Shortcode with a GUI for the Widget edit section.  
**The only required attribute for all Shortcodes is `set_id`. All other attributes are optional!**

### <a name="shortcode-builder"></a>Shortcode Builder

The [Opening Hours Shortcode Builder](http://bit.ly/2mmneSk) assembles shortcodes for you that you can copy and insert into your content. This is particularly useful for people who are unfamiliar with shortcodes.

The builder can be found at [https://janizde.github.io/opening-hours-shortcode-builder/](http://bit.ly/2mmneSk)  
Development takes place in the [GitHub Repo](http://bit.ly/35rsQiD)

In the edit page of parent sets the button *Create a Shortcode* opens the shortcode builder in a popup and prefills the `set_id` accordingly.

### <a name="common-attributes"></a>Common attributes for all Shortcodes

## <a name="troubleshooting"></a>Troubleshooting / FAQ
### Where can I set the standard date and time formats?
If you worked with previous verions of the Plugin you may miss the settings page. The new version of the Plugin uses your WordPress setting you can set under **Settings > General**  
Furthermore you may also set your custom date and time formates per Widget / Shortcode.

### The Is Open Widget / Shortcode does not work properly
The calculation of the Is Open status depends on the Timezone setting in WordPress. Please double check your Timezone setting under **Settings > General** before opening an issue.

### How can I change the styling of the widgets / shortcodes?
The Plugin provides very minimal styling, which is the red and green colors for the open / closed messages. All other kind of styling is left to the WordPress Theme you are using or your custom CSS.
To disable the styling of the text color the [`op_use_front_end_styles`](https://github.com/janizde/WP-Opening-Hours/blob/master/doc/filters.md#op_use_front_end_styles) filter hook can be used.

## <a name="contributing"></a>Contributing
### <a name="contributing-to-code"></a>Contribute to Code

The development of the Opening Hours Plugin takes place at [GitHub](https://github.com/janizde/WP-Opening-Hours).  
If you want to contribute feel free to fork the repository and send pull requests.

##### <a name="git-flow"></a>GitFlow
The project uses GitFlow. You can get more information on GitFlow on the [GitFlow Cheat Sheet](http://danielkummer.github.io/git-flow-cheatsheet/).  
When forking the repository for contributions please fork from the `develop` branch. If the pull request will be accepted it will be released to the `master` branch for a new version of the Plugin.

##### Unit Testing
The core logic of the Plugin (classes that are not in the `OpeningHours\Module` namespace) is covered with [PHPUnit](https://phpunit.de/) tests (version 4.8).  
If you find an issue in the core logic please write one or more unit test which demonstrate this issue. If you add something to the core logic please also write a unit test. Also, before sending a pull request, run all unit tests to check whether your change has broken anything (it will be automatically tested by travis anyway).

### <a name="contributing-to-translations"></a>Contribute to Translations

(Plugin) translation files (`.po` and `.mo`) files contain translations for all strings that are included in the plugin source code, e.g. labels for the widget edit inputs. In this plugin this are mostly strings that occur in the WordPress admin.  
This means you can customize every string presented on your WordPress Front-End site using Widget and/or Shortcode options. If the Plugin has not yet been translated to your language and you are fine with English in your WordPress admin you do not have to submit your own translations but can cutomize the Widget/Shortcode strings to match the language of your site.
However, you can still submit your translations to [Polyglots](#polyglots) so other Plugin users can benefit from it.

The translations of weekdays are not included in the Plugin translations but are loaded from the WordPress core translations. This serves the purpose, that these are always translated to the language that your WordPress installation runs on independently of the Plugin translation progress.

#### <a name="polyglots"></a>[WordPress Polyglots](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-opening-hours)
Polyglots is the name of the community of volunteers translating WordPress resources like Themes, Plugins and also the WordPress core. It has become a central place for WordPress translation and is tightly coupled with the WordPress Theme/Plugin repositories.

Since version 2.0 the translation of the Opening Hours Plugin takes place at [translate.wordpress.org](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-opening-hours). Advantages of using Polyglots:

* Larger translation community
* Translation can be separated from the actual development of the Plugin
* Supports automatic translation updates, so you do not have to wait for the next release to get new translations

If you want to contribute to translations and there is no Project Translation Editor for your locale, please drop me a message or open an issue with your WordPress.org username and I will request an editorship for your locale.  
You can find out more about project translation roles [here.](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/about/teams/)  

If you have already translated the Plugin on translate.jannikportz.de, I have transferred all translations to the [translate.wordpress.org project](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/wp-opening-hours).
You will then also need to become a Project Translation Editor to approve your translations (I know this is a bit tedious).
So in this case please also drop me a message or open an issue with your WordPress.org account name.

If you can not translate the whole plugin or don't want to wait until everything is approved you may perform the following steps to immediately use your translations.

1. Select the translation set in the list of available languages.
1. Scroll to the bottom.
1. In the line below the legend, select `all current` as `Machine Object Message (.mo)` and click `Export`.
1. Rename the file to `wp-opening-hours-{locale}.mo` (replace `{locale}` with the actual locale of the translation, e.g. `de_DE` for German).
1. Move the file to `/path/to/wordpress/wp-content/languages/plugins`

#### Pull Request on GitHub
Translations via Pull Request on GitHub are no longer supported and won't be merged in the future, as translation now takes place at WordPress Polyglots. Please refer to [the section on WordPress Polyglots](#polyglots)

#### translate.jannikportz.de
translate.jannikportz.de has been shut down in favor of WordPress Polyglots. Please refer to [the section on WordPress Polyglots](#polyglots)
