Opening Hours is a highly customizable WordPress plugin to set up your venue's opening hours and display them with Shortcodes and Widgets.

== Description ==

* Supports multiple Sets of Opening Hours (e.g. one for your restaurant and one for your bar) that you can use independently.
* Supports Holidays
* Supports Irregular Openings (e.g. different opening hours during Christmas)
* Supports child sets that overwrite your regular opening hours in a specific time period (e.g. seasonal opening hours or an extra day in every second week)
* Four highly customizable Widgets and Shortcodes also displaying contextual information (e.g. "We're currently closed but will be open again on Monday at 8am")

= Widgets =

* Overview Widget: Lists up all Opening Hours with contextual information in a table or list
* Is Open Widget: Indicates whether the selected venue is currently open or closed and optionally shows when it will be open again
* Holidays Widget: Lists up all Holidays in a table or list
* Irregular Openings Widget: Lists up all Irregular Openings in a table or list
* Schema.org Widgets: Inserts structured [JSON-LD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON-LD) into a WordPress page or post

= Shortcodes =

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How can I change the styling of the widgets / shortcodes? =

The Plugin provides very minimal styling, which is the red and green colors for the open / closed messages. All other kind of styling is left to the WordPress Theme you are using or your custom CSS.
To disable the styling of the text color the [`op_use_front_end_styles`](https://github.com/janizde/WP-Opening-Hours/blob/master/doc/filters.md#op_use_front_end_styles) filter hook can be used.

= My language is not provided in the Plugin =
